<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>Hi I'm Tommy Gaessler!</p>

<p>I am a Senior Developer Advocate and Software Engineer at <a href="https://zoom.com" target="_blank">Zoom</a>, for the <a href="https://developers.zoom.us/docs/video-sdk/" target="_blank">Video SDK</a> and <a href="https://developers.zoom.us/docs/meeting-sdk/" target="_blank">Meeting SDK</a>.</p>

<p>As Senior Developer Advocate and Software Engineer at Zoom, I wear many hats, including writing production code, building <a href="https://github.com/zoom" target="_blank">sample apps</a> and <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/~tommygaessler" target="_blank">NPM packages</a>, managing products, supporting sales, speaking at <a routerLink="/talks" routerLinkActive="active">conferences and meetups</a>, writing dev docs and <a href="https://www.zoom.com/en/blog/?q=tommy%20gaessler&sort=newest" target="_blank">blogs</a>, and growing the developer community.</p>

<p>Before Zoom, I was a founding engineer at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/apostrophe-inc./about/" target="_blank">Apostrophe</a>, a <a href="https://www.techstars.com/portfolio?q=apostrophe" target="_blank">Techstars Boulder</a> startup that was later acquired by <a href="https://centivo.com/" target="_blank">Centivo</a>.</p>

<p>If you're building with the <a href="https://developers.zoom.us/" target="_blank">Zoom Developer Platform</a>, want to <a routerLink="/talks" routerLinkActive="active">book me for a conference or meetup talk</a>, or just want to connect, feel free to <a routerLink="/contact" routerLinkActive="active">reach out</a>, I'd love to hear from you!</p>
